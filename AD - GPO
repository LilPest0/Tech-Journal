Creating an OU via Powershell
- can be done using the command "new-adorganizationalunit "Software Deploy""

Deleting an OU via Powershell
- can be done using the command "Remove-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity "OU=TestOU""
- I ran into an issue where I had an option selected in the OU's properties to protect it from accidental deletion.
- I was able to bypass this by:
  going into the Active Directory Administrative Center in Windows Server Manager on MGMT01
  select OU > Properties > Uncheck the "Protect from accidental deletion" box & click OK
 
Moving items from one OU to another is as easy as dragging them from place to place in GUI. 
I just clicked and dragged like usual on windows

Searching the Event Log using Powershell
- can be done using the command "get-eventlog"
- I used "get-eventlog -logname System -newest 15" to show the 15 newest logs. Here I found the one for the PuTTY installation.

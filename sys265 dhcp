In this activity, I used my pfSense firewall to configure it as a DHCP server for my subnet. 

I started by logging into the server using Chrome on wks01. 
The next step was to navigate to the services tab, then to "dhcp server"
Then I configured the following settings:
- enabled dhcp server on lan interface
- set ip range from .150 - .175
- added 10.0.5.5 (mgmt01) as a dns server
- set 10.0.5.2 as the default gateway

Finally, I backtracked to the internet adapter settings on wks01, and enabled dhcp. Then i executed ipconfig /all to confirm that it was on and working

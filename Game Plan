Next class, my professor will rain destruction and horror on my network as he wipes it clean and I am challenged to rebuild it in 24 hours. 
This is my plan.

I will start from the very beginning at Lab 1. This will give me a chance to recognize my mistakes and make my network better than ever before. 
As I go through the labs, I will have the oppurtunity to use what I've learned in class to reconstruct the system. 
I will also have research at my fingertips.

This task will call for dedication and perseverence. But this time I've got a game plan.

This was one of the harder labs I've had to do so far this semester.
To begin with, I was given a new Ubuntu box that had to be networked differently than our other devices. 

Figuring this out was probably the hardest part of the lab.
To connect it to the DNS, I had to go into a new file called resolv.conf, and update the "nameserver" value. Notably, it worked in nano but not in vim.

The next step was to install docker. The installation was pretty easy and intuitive, especially since we were provided an article on how to do it. 
Then I had to confirm that my named sudo account could access Docker by joining it to the Docker group. 

After this, I did the Docker hello world, which demonstrated that docker can find packages, download and executed them as needed. This meant that it was up and running successfully.

Next I set up docker-compose, a tool allowing you to run multi-container application enviornments. After this i was able to figure out how to pull basic web applications with it.
Then I accessed the docker01-benji through a web browser, to view a webpage that I was hosting off of it. It was starting to come together!

The final step was to get wordpress working through docker to make a more intricate page. Here I had to configure a strangely delicate file called docker-compose.yml, which
was configuration stuff for the wordpress. Once I got the spaces for indentations right, I was able to type it out and get it working.

Notes:
- I configured docker01-benji so that you couldnt ssh in as root. That way it adds another layer of security. I just had to make sure later on to add "benji" to the docker group.
- docker commands are pretty easy. Run, ps, and stop were the most frequently used.
